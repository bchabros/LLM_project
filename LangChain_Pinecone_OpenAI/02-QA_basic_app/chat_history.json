They were introduced in a 2017 paper titled \"Attention is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al.\n\nIn traditional deep learning models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), information flows sequentially from one step to the next. However, transformers take a different approach by utilizing a mechanism called self-attention.\n\nIn transformers, the input is divided into sequences of fixed-length vectors called tokens. Each token is accompanied by an embedding, which captures its semantic meaning. The core idea behind transformers is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different tokens when processing the input sequence.\n\nThe self-attention mechanism calculates attention weights for each token in relation to all other tokens in the input sequence. These weights reflect the relevance or importance of each token concerning the others. By using these attention weights, the model can focus more on tokens that are most informative for the current task.\n\nThe transformer architecture consists of multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward neural networks. In each layer, the self-attention mechanism captures the relationships between tokens, and the feed-forward networks process the attended representations to obtain more abstract features. These layers can be stacked to provide a deeper and more expressive model.\n\nDuring training, transformers employ a method called \"masked self-attention\" to prevent the model from attending to future tokens and maintain causality. This means the model can process each token without having access to subsequent tokens, making it suitable for tasks like machine translation where output is generated one token at a time.\n\nAfter training, transformers can be used for various NLP tasks such as machine translation, question answering, sentiment analysis, and more. The attention mechanism allows the model to capture long-range dependencies efficiently, making transformers capable of processing inputs of variable length and achieving state-of-the-art performance in many tasks.\n\nIn summary, transformers in deep learning work by utilizing self-attention mechanisms to capture relationships between input tokens, allowing the model to weigh their importance and efficiently process long-range dependencies, making them powerful for various natural language processing tasks.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "ai", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": [], "usage_metadata": null}}, {"type": "human", "data": {"content": "Co to jest wakeboard?", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "human", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false}}, {"type": "ai", "data": {"content": "Wakeboard to deska do uprawiania sport\u00f3w wodnych, kt\u00f3ra jest u\u017cywana do jazdy po wodzie za \u0142odzi\u0105 lub na specjalnych torach wakeboardowych.
